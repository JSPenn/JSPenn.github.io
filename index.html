        <h2>Tourist Destination Recommendation System</h2>
        <p>
          In this project, I developed a recommendation system that suggests tourist destinations to users based on their preferences and past experiences.
          Using Machine Learning algorithms and Python, I was able to create a system that provides personalized and relevant recommendations to users, improving their travel experience.
